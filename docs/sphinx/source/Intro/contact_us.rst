Getting Help
=============

Slack and JIRA are only available for **JGI Staff**. If these avenues are not available, you can write an email to jaws-support@lbl.gov.


-------------------------------
Create a JIRA Ticket for Issues
-------------------------------

   To open a JIRA Ticket, go to (`JGI Intranet -> SUPPORT -> JGIâ€™s Analysis Workflow Service (JAWS) <https://intranet.lbl.gov/jgi/services/computers-networking/jaws/>`_)


-----------------------------
Using SLACK to Ask a Question
-----------------------------

   Under the workspace: **joint-genome-inst.slack.com** there is a **#jaws** channel.


-------------------------------
Request for Paired Programming
-------------------------------
You can request to schedule a zoom meeting with a JAWS team member to work with you to get your workflow running via Cromwell and JAWS.  

Send an email to jaws-support@lbl.gov.

Via the email or during the meeting, please expect to answer the following:  

	1. Do you have either a process (set of well-defined manual steps) or a pipeline (steps already strung together by some script/framework)?   

	2. Do you have any documentation for your pipeline?  Please provide the link.   

	3. Do you have a good idea of the compute resource requirements for each step?  (i.e. time, ram, cpu)   

	4. Were you the author of the process/pipeline?  Who else contributed to it and are they still available to answer questions if needed?   

	5. Do you have experience making Docker containers?   

	6. Do you have a hard deadline to get the WDL running?   

	7. Is the workflow to be publicly released?
