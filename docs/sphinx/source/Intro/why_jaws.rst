WHY Use JAWS
#############

.. role:: bash(code)
  :language: bash

| * With a simple command :bash:`jaws run submit` you can submit a workflow to a robust framework that makes running pipelines easier by using existing, proven technology that conveniently masks the details of how and where the jobs.
| 
| * You can monitor your jobs with different levels of detail, like :bash:`jaws run log`
| 
| * You have access to multiple compute sites by specifying a site in the command like to Cori. The full command would be :bash:`jaws run submit <wdl> <inputs.json> <outdir> cori`  
| 
| * When developing a pipeline for JAWS, the compute resources can be made to match the requiremnts of each task. Therefore, any user of the pipeline can assume that the pipeline will run efficiently.
