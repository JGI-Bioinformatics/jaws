How to Share Workflows 
===================================

You can share JGI workflows with the scientific community by adding them to the JGI maintained gitlab group `JGI WDL Pipelines <https://code.jgi.doe.gov/official-jgi-workflows/wdl-specific-repositories>`_. A gitlab group is just a collection of repositories that share permissions. 

There are two options: 
  1. you can just create a link in this group to your existing repository 
  2. you can create the repository under this group.

Directions are under the readme `How to Add Projects to this Group <https://code.jgi.doe.gov/official-jgi-workflows/wdl-specific-repositories/how-to-add-projects>`_
