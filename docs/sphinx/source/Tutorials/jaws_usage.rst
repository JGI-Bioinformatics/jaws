**See status of the JAWS services**

.. code-block:: text

    jaws health

    {
    ASSEMBLY-Cromwell: UP,
    ASSEMBLY-RMQ: UP,
    ASSEMBLY-Site: UP,
    AWS-Cromwell: UP,
    AWS-RMQ: UP,
    AWS-Site: UP,

    }


**To run a wdl**

One of the two required files is an inputs(json) file. You can generate one from scratch by running :bash:`jaws inputs <WDL>` which will print out a template based on the WDL, you just need to fill out the values.

A simple example template would look like:

.. code-block:: text

    {
      fq_count.fastq_file: File
    }

To submit a run

.. code-block:: text

  jaws submit my.wdl my.json cori

  # output looks like
  {
    max_ram_gb: 10,
    run_id: 7235,
  }

Include a tag for your run to help keep track of things. :bash:`jaws status` will display the tag.

.. code-block:: text

  jaws submit --tag 'some useful info' my.wdl my.json cori

Run with Cromwell's call-caching off. Call-caching will allow you to re-run JAWS submissions without re-running tasks that completed successfully. However, this is not always desirable and you can turn caching off.

.. code-block:: text

  jaws submit --no-cache my.wdl my.json cori


**Monitor your Run**

The examples are in order of verbosity.

.. code-block:: text

  # overview of the whole WDL
  jaws status 7235

  or

  # the times each stage started, e.g. queued, running, etc.
  jaws log 7235

  or

  # the times each task entered each stage 
  jaws task-log 7235


**Understanding the Stages**

These are the possible states, in order, that a JAWS run passes through. 

.. code-block:: text

    created:             The Run was accepted and a run_id assigned.
    upload queued:       The Run's input files are waiting to be transferred to the compute-site.
    uploading:           Your Run's input files are being transferred to the compute-site.
    upload failed:       The transfer of your run to the compute-site failed.
    upload inactive:     Globus transfer stalled.
    upload complete:     Your Run's input files have been transferred to the compute-site successfully.
    ready:               The Run has been transferred to the compute-site.
    missing input:       The run was uploaded but some of the required files were missing.
    submitted:           The run has been submitted to Cromwell and tasks should start to queue within moments,
    submission failed:   The run was submitted to Cromwell but rejected due to invalid input.
    queued:              At least one task has requested resources but no tasks have started running yet.
    running:             The run is being executed; you can check `task-log` for more detail.
    succeeded:           The run has completed successfully.
    failed:              The run has failed; see: `errors` and `metadata` for more detail.
    finished:            The run has completed, metadata has been saved, and is ready to download.
    aborting:            Your run is in the process of being canceled.
    aborted:             The run was cancelled.
    download queued:     Your Run's output files are waiting to be transferred from the compute-site.
    downloading:         The Run's output files are being transferred from the compute-site.
    download failed:     The Run's output files could not be transferred from the compute-site.
    download inactive:   Globus transfer stalled.
    download complete:   Your Run's output (succeeded or failed) are available for you to `get`.
    email sent:          Notification of run completion was sent via email.
    done:                The run is complete.

**Get current or old history of jobs owned by you**

.. code-block:: text

   # get list of your currently running jobs
   jaws queue
   
   # view history of your jobs for last 7 days
   jaws history

   There are options to use with history
     --days INTEGER  history going back this many days; default=1
     --site TEXT     limit results to this compute-site; default=all
     --result TEXT   limit results to this result; default=any
     --all           List runs from all users; default=False

**Debugging**

:bash:`jaws errors` is a catch-all command for viewing errors.

This command should capture errors from

1. cromwell 
2. the WDL tasks
3. HTCondor backend
4. Slurm

You can see these same errors when running other commands like 

.. code-block:: text

    # Some errors are generated by the backend (i.e. HTCondor) like timeout errors & bad docker image names.
    # You can see these with the task-log command
    jaws task-log 7235

.. code-block:: text

    # metadata shows cromwell server log
    jaws metadata 7235


.. note::
    Cromwell will created a stderr, stdout, script and script.submit file for each task. These are handy for debugging. See the next section to find these files.


**Getting your output**

The preferable way to get your results is by using the get command.  The benifits of this method is that you can opt to not copy many of the temp files but only copy the files that you've listed in the :bash:`outputs` section in the main section of the WDL. If you want everything in the :bash:`execution` directory, then use the --complete flag.  Remember, if you don't get your files, they will be subject to the scheduled purge of the staging directory.

Note that the :bash:`--complete` flag will also give you your original main.wdl, the inputs.json, and a zip file of any sub-wdls you may of had.

.. code-block:: text

    jaws get 7235 myresults
	or
    jaws get 7235 --complete myresults

The second way to find your results would be to run the status command and look for the path for :bash:`output_dir`.  However, this path only should exist on the SITE that you ran on.  The results should include all raw cromwell output.

The input files will also be in this output_dir, and thus uneccessarily copied over if you chose to use this path.

.. code-block:: text

    jaws status --verbose 7235 | grep output_dir

    output_dir: /global/cfs/projectdirs/jaws/data-repository-prod/jfroula/CORI/7235,


**Specialty Commands**

This command uses the womtool.jar (developed by same people as cromwell.jar) as a linter for your WDLs. You would use this when developing a WDL.

.. code-block:: text

    jaws validate my.wdl


The --user flag allows someone to use a different jaws token than the default. This way, you can have a token representing a user like 'rqc' or 'jaws-admin' with certain permissions. Then multiple people from a group can use this token to have access to certain files.
.. code-block:: text

    jaws --user <~/jaws.conf> <some command>
