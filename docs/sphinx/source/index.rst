The `Joint Genome Institute <https://jgi.doe.gov>`_ has developed JAWS (JGI Analysis Workflow Service) as a framework to run computational workflows. Its purpose is to improve the re-usability and robustness of workflows in a high performance computing (`HPC <https://www.nics.tennessee.edu/computing-resources/what-is-hpc>`_), cluster, and cloud environments.

Summary of JAWS
---------------

* JAWS should simplify your workflow submissions because it takes care of resource configuration and scheduling

* Before using JAWS, workflows need to be wrapped in the human readable `Workflow Definition Language (WDL) <https://software.broadinstitute.org/wdl/>`_

* JAWS commands can be integrated into larger workflows since everything is CLI based.
